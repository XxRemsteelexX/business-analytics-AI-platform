# Interactive Data Filtering Feature

## Overview
This feature adds interactive data filtering capabilities to the business analytics platform. Users can now filter large datasets using slider controls to view specific portions of their data, while still having the option to view the entire dataset.

## Implementation Details

### Components Added
1. **DataFilterControls** - A new React component that provides slider controls for data filtering
2. **Enhanced Data Filtering** - Modifications to the EnhancedCharts component to support dynamic data filtering

### Features
- Slider controls for selecting data range (start and end indices)
- Manual input fields for precise data range selection
- Visual progress bar showing the current data range
- Reset button to return to full dataset view
- Automatic filtering of all charts based on selected data range
- Responsive design that works with different screen sizes

### How It Works
1. When a dataset with more than 50 records is loaded, the data filter controls automatically appear
2. Users can adjust the start and end sliders to select a specific range of data
3. The charts automatically update to show only the selected data range
4. Users can manually enter specific start/end indices in the input fields
5. The visual progress bar shows the current selection relative to the full dataset
6. The "Reset View" button restores the full dataset view

### Technical Implementation
- The filtering is implemented by slicing the original dataset based on the selected range
- Each chart maintains its own filtered data copy to ensure consistent rendering
- The filtering logic preserves all data integrity and chart functionality
- The UI components are built using the existing design system (Tailwind CSS, Radix UI)

## Usage Instructions
1. Upload a dataset with more than 50 records
2. Navigate to the analytics dashboard
3. Use the slider controls to filter the data:
   - Drag the "Start Index" slider to set the beginning of the data range
   - Drag the "End Index" slider to set the end of the data range
   - Enter specific values in the input fields for precise control
4. View the filtered data in all charts
5. Use the "Reset View" button to return to the full dataset

## Benefits
- Enables analysis of large datasets without performance issues
- Provides fine-grained control over data visualization
- Maintains the ability to view the complete dataset when needed
- Improves user experience with intuitive slider controls
- Works seamlessly with all existing chart types (bar, line, pie)
