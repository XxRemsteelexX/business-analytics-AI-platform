## Project Information: business-analytics-AI-platform

### Technology Stack
- Next.js 14
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Recharts
- Azure OpenAI API

### Working Directory
/home/yeblad/Desktop/business-analytics-AI-platform

### What We've Done

1. Fixed Data Display Issues:
   - Removed artificial data limits that were truncating 185-player dataset
   - All players now display by default in charts
   - Fixed interactive filtering with sliders

2. Resolved Chart Rendering Problems:
   - Removed scatter plots causing "unsupported chart type" errors
   - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in EnhancedCharts component
   - Improved chart diversity and reduced duplication

3. Server Configuration:
   - Created proper .env file with API configuration
   - Server now running on http://localhost:3000 (process ID 357947)

4. Environment Setup:
   - Configured Azure OpenAI environment variables in .env file
   - Set up proper authentication secrets
   - Configured database (SQLite) for development

### Current Status

Working Features:
- ✅ Data upload and parsing (CSV files)
- ✅ Automatic chart generation (bar, line, pie, histograms)
- ✅ Interactive data filtering with sliders
- ✅ Full dataset display (185 players)
- ✅ Executive and Analyst dashboard views
- ✅ Responsive chart rendering

Not Working:
- ❌ AI Assistant - "Sorry, I could not generate a response" error
- ❌ Chat functionality with AI

### AI Assistant Issue

The AI assistant is not working despite having configured the environment variables. The chat API route exists at /app/api/chat/route.ts and attempts to connect to Azure OpenAI, but returns "Sorry, I could not generate a response". This could be due to:

1. Invalid or missing Azure OpenAI API key in .env
2. Incorrect Azure endpoint configuration
3. Network/firewall issues
4. API key permissions or quota limits

### Next Steps to Fix AI

1. Verify Azure OpenAI API key in /home/yeblad/Desktop/business-analytics-AI-platform/.env
2. Confirm Azure OpenAI service is properly configured and accessible
3. Check server logs for specific error messages from the chat API
4. Test direct API connectivity to Azure OpenAI endpoint
